# Alice is still not satisfied with Bob's math skills so she gave him a new challenge.

# Given a positive integer NN, find any 33 distinct positive integers A, B, CA,B,C such that:

# The product of any two of these 33 integers is a divisor of NN.
# The product of all three integers is a multiple of NN.
# If multiple solutions exist, you may print any of them.
# Print -1âˆ’1 if no solution exists.
