# Problem
# Chef has finally got the chance of his lifetime to drive in the 
# �
# 1
# F1 tournament. But, there is one problem. Chef did not know about the 107% rule and now he is worried whether he will be allowed to race in the main event or not.

# Given the fastest finish time as 
# �
# X seconds and Chef's finish time as 
# �
# Y seconds, determine whether Chef will be allowed to race in the main event or not.

# Note that, Chef will only be allowed to race if his finish time is within 107% of the fastest finish time.
